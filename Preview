As a personal project, I focused on predicting customer churn and gaining insights into the Customer Attrition Rate for a company. The project aimed to classify customers based on their last transaction and determine the proportion of customer churn among a dataset of 10,000 customers.
Through this project, I gained valuable experience in predicting customer churn and analyzing customer attrition rates. By utilizing machine learning algorithms and data visualization techniques, I was able to provide insights that could help the company make informed decisions regarding customer retention strategies.
