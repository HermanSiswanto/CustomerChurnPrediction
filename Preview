As a personal project, I undertook the task of developing a Telco Customer Churn Prediction system. The project aimed to predict customer churn for a dataset of 7,043 customers.
Through the Telco Customer Churn Prediction project, I gained hands-on experience in applying various machine learning algorithms, analyzing model performance, and generating actionable insights from the results. This project exemplifies my ability to tackle real-world problems, make data-driven predictions, and contribute to the field of customer churn analysis.
